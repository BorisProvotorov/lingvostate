            <h3 class="section-services__title">Certified Translation</h3>
            <p>When you're using documents abroad for legal purposes, they often need to be translated and certified first. This includes legal documents, medical records and immigration documents, academic certificates and diplomas, passports and Identification documents, as well as personal certificates such as birth, death, or divorce certificates.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-services__item">
            <h3 class="section-services__title">Public Notary Service</h3>
            <p>We work with a network of trusted public notaries across the UK, as many legal documents specify that a notary public will be needed to notarise it. Common examples include verifying personal documents for marriage abroad, employment outside the UK, or for immigration and emigration purposes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-services__item">
            <h3 class="section-services__title">Legalisation (Apostille)</h3>
            <p>A UK Apostille is an official certificate issued by the UK Government that verifies the signatures and seals of a notary or public official. It`s required to ensure your UK documents are legally accepted in other countries. By confirming the document’s authenticity under the Hague Apostille Convention, an Apostille lets foreign authorities know it is genuine and trustworthy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-services__item">
            <h3 class="section-services__title">“True copy” certification</h3>
            <p>If you're applying for something overseas or to organizations in UK, such as banks, you may need to submit documents like birth or marriage certificates, passports, photocard driving licences, letters from government departments, banks, building societies, or credit card statements, as well as gas, electricity or council tax bills, and letters from a hospitals or doctors. You might be asked for a “true copy.” Just bring us the original, and we’ll provide a certified and stamped copy that meets the necessary requirements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section-services__item">
            <h3 class="section-services__title">Power of Attorney</h3>
            <p>A Power of Attorney is a legal document that lets someone you trust handle important things for you —such as managing finances, property, or healthcare— when you can’t or don’t want to take care of them yourself, especially if you live or are staying abroad.</p>
